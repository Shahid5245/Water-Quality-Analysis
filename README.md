# Water-Quality-Analysis
Using EDA process to analysis the water quality analysis 


One of the main areas of research in EDA analysis of water qulaity. It is also known as water potability analysis. It is understand all the factor that affect the water potability. i will be using a Kaggle dataset that contains all of the major factors that affect the potability of water. 


Dataset contains rows - 3276, columns- 10 with CSV extension 


The Potability column of this dataset is need to predict because it contains value 0 and 1 that indicates whether the water is potable(1) or unfit(0) for consumption

# Steps-on-EDA
1. Start the analysis by importing Python Libraries and the dataset
2. I caan see the nan/null values of this dataset, so before we go ahead, let's fill the NAN values by using mean
3. As mentioned above, there are no factors that we cannot ignore that affect water quality, so let's explore all the columns one by one
4. The pH column represent the pH value of the water 
5. the pH value of drinking water should be between 6.5 to 8.5
